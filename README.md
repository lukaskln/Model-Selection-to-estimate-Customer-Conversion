## About the Project

This project is based on a Kaggle competition.

Launching an ad campaign is often a big investment and we would like to know that an ad campaign reaches and “converts”
as many internet users as possible. In this case, a major tech company seeks to assess if their recent ad campaign
for their online service was effective. The effectiveness is measured by “conversion”, which occurs if the users who saw
the ad clicked on it and subscribed to the service. The goal of this project is to optimize the prediction of user conversion
based on different measures on the characteristics of the user and their interaction with this ad.

## The Code 

The code is in R, but Python backend is used to compute neural networks with TensorFlow. The project includes seven scripts going from exploratory analysis and feature engineering/selection, over model estimation, to inference and evaluation. For data rights reasons is the respective dataset not included in this repository. All visualizations done in the code can be found in the graphics folder.
